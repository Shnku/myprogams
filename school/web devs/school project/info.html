			<h1>How can we prevent getting the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?</h1>
				<p>Right now, the best defense to prevent getting COVID-19 is to follow some of the same steps you would take to prevent getting other viruses, such as the common cold or the <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4335-influenza-flu">flu</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Wash your hands</a> for at least 20 seconds— especially before eating and preparing food, after using the bathroom, after wiping your nose, and after coming in contact with someone who has a cold.</li>
					<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses from your hands.</li>
					<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and coughing or sneeze and cough into your sleeve. Throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands afterward. Never cough or sneeze into your hands!</li>
					<li>Avoid close contact (within six feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick. Stay home if you are sick.</li>
					<li>If you are prone to sickness or have a weakened immune system, stay away from large crowds of people. Follow the directions of your healthcare authorities especially during outbreaks.</li>
					<li>Clean frequently used surfaces (such as doorknobs and counter tops) with a virus-killing disinfectant.</li>
					<li>Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.</li>
					<li>Greet people with a friendly gesture instead of shaking hands.</li>
					<li>Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of liquids and exercise if you are able. These steps will strengthen your immune system and enable you to fight off infections easier.</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>Wearing Face- Mask..</h1>
					<p>The CDC recommends wearing a cloth face coverings in public, especially in places where it’s hard to maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and another person. Face masks protect both you and the people around you. Cloth face masks are being recommended because we now know individuals with COVID-19 could have mild or no symptoms, while still spreading the virus to others.</p>
					<p>The cloth face coverings recommended by the CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders.</p>
