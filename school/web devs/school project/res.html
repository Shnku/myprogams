		<h2 align="center"><font color="red">How does the new coronavirus (COVID-19) spread from person to person?</h2>
			<p>COVID-19 is likely spread:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the virus travels in respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you (within six feet). This is thought to be the main way COVID-19 is spread.</li>
				<li>When the virus travels in small respiratory droplets that linger in the air for minutes to hours from an infected person who is more than six feet away or has since left the space. This method of spread is more likely to occur in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.
				<li>From close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person.
				<li>By touching surfaces that the virus has landed on, then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands. (Not thought to spread easily by this method.)
			</ul>
