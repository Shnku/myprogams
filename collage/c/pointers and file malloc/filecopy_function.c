/*
//?1. Using uninitialized file pointers
The main function uses two file pointers opn and cpy, which have not been initialized to any value before being passed into the file_copy function.


FILE *opn, *cpy;
file_copy(opn, "file1.txt", cpy, "file2.txt");
This results in undefined behavior since these pointers may contain garbage value, which can cause unexpected results or crashes.

//?3. No error checking after writing to output file
The file_copy function doesn't check if the output file operation fputc was successful or not. It only prints a message when reach end-of-file of the input file, but there could be errors at other times that aren't handled.

*/
/*
?sollution...
Removed pointers from the file copy function signature and updated null checking
Removed the global scope on file pointers by scoping ones required.
Changed condition for copying file to avoid usage of feof
Introduced error checking when trying to write to output file using fputc
Properly closed the files at the end
These changes make the code more robust, safer and easier to maintain.
