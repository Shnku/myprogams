# Presume that a ladder is put upright against a wall. Let variables length and angle store the length of the ladder and the angle that it forms with the ground as it leans against the wall. Write a Python program to compute the height reached by the ladder on the wall for the following values of length and angle:
#     a) 16 feet and 75 degrees
#     b) 20 feet and 0 degrees
#     c) 24 feet and 45 degrees
#     d) 24 feet and 80 degrees

def hight_distanse(distance,angle):
    pass
