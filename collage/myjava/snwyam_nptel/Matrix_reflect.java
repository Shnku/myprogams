/*
 class Matrix_reflect
 Problem statement:

A program needs to be developed which can mirror reflect any 5 × 5 2D character array into its side-by-side reflection. Write suitable code to achieve this transformation as shown below:

 INPUT:                                       OUTPUT:
               OOXOO                                        OOXOO
               OOXOO                                        OOXOO
               XXXOO                                        OOXXX
               OOOOO                                        OOOOO
               XOABC                                        CBAOX

Note the following points carefully:
1. Here, instead of X and O any character may be present.
2. The input and output array size must be of dimension 5 × 5 and nothing else.
3. Only side-by-side reflection should be performed i.e. ABC || CBA.
