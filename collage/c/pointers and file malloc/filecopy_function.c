/*
//?1. Using uninitialized file pointers
The main function uses two file pointers opn and cpy, which have not been initialized to any value before being passed into the file_copy function.


FILE *opn, *cpy;
file_copy(opn, "file1.txt", cpy, "file2.txt");
This results in undefined behavior since these pointers may contain garbage value, which can cause unexpected results or crashes.

//?2. Incorrect use of feof
The file_copy function uses feof incorrectly to determine if the end of the input file has been reached.


while (!feof(open))
{
    fputc(fgetc(open), to_copy);
}
The problem with this approach is that feof returns true only after an attempt has been made to read beyond the end of the file. So, it may result in extra characters being copied, depending on how fgetc is implemented.

//?3. No error checking after writing to output file
The file_copy function doesn't check if the output file operation fputc was successful or not. It only prints a message when reach end-of-file of the input file, but there could be errors at other times that aren't handled.

//?4. Overwriting input file pointer values
The variable open and to_copy reassignment in the code below appears innocent and makes the code look cleaner but it can confuse someone who isnâ€™t familiar with such operation.

if (((open = fopen(f1, "r")) == NULL) || (to_copy = fopen(f2, "w")) == NULL)
The operation attempts to open the given files and if either fails then we print an error message and exit with a failure. However it is unclear if the arguments passed to file_copy should affect the values of its parameters. This could also cause confusion down the line.

/*
?sollution...
Removed pointers from the file copy function signature and updated null checking
Removed the global scope on file pointers by scoping ones required.
Changed condition for copying file to avoid usage of feof
Introduced error checking when trying to write to output file using fputc
Properly closed the files at the end
These changes make the code more robust, safer and easier to maintain.
